# Wireshark Networking Experiments and Documentation

This repository documents my networking experiments and projects using Wireshark. It covers various aspects of network traffic capture, detailed analysis, and troubleshooting techniques. Included are comprehensive write-ups and general documentation that explain my hands-on experiences with Wireshark â€” from identifying vulnerabilities and detecting insecure protocols to analyzing suspicious traffic patterns. My goal is to demonstrate how effective packet analysis can enhance network security by uncovering and addressing potential threats.
